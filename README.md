# VitruvianApp2016

This was the App I developed for my FRC Team 4201 for the 2016 Competition season.

This App utilizes Parse as its cloud database.

Learning from last year's experiences, this year's app was largely functional and primarily used for our scouting needs during the competition.

One of the major nuances with this App is that it only points to one competition (database) at a time to simplify usage for students.

There was also a bug within the code, which makes the points scored during a single match be calculated incorrectly. This didn't really pose much of an issue during the competition season in determining our strategy/analysis. The bug still exists in this fork.
